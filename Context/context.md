## Context
Context aka **this** is the reference to an object that own currently executing code.

## Context vs Scope
- Context is more object specific while Scope is related to variables & functions

## :thumbsup: Rules
- In browser, **window** is the global object that means default context would be
  ```this = window```
- ```this``` is nothing but a function caller or owner object
- Context & Scope are not same
